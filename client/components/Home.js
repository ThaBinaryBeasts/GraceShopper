        The sweetness of corn. The spiciness of rye. The smoothness of wheat.
        The smokiness of peated malt. The tannic and vanilla flavors imparted by
        aging in oak. There are so many different reasons to like whiskey. The
        incredibly complex combinations of smells and flavors is nearly
        limitless. “Whiskey is sunlight held together by water.” Plus, you know,
        it gets you drunk. If you're into that sort of thing.
