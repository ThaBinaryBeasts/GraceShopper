      <p>
        Welcome to Off The Barrel. We're a start-up company trying to spread the
        love of whiskey to the rest of the world. From cocktails to on the
        rocks. Whiskey has been a way to appreciate something taking time to
        perfect. The sweetness of corn. The spiciness of rye. The smoothness of
        wheat. The smokiness of peated malt. The tannic and vanilla flavors
        imparted by aging in oak. There are so many different reasons to like
        whiskey. The incredibly complex combinations of smells and flavors is
        nearly limitless. “Whiskey is sunlight held together by water.” Plus,
        you know, it gets you drunk. If you're into that sort of thing.
